h2. 1.1

h3. Changes
  * The event is no longer added to #options at triggering time.
  * Options passed in #render_widget are no longer merged with #options. They are passed as state-args to reduce complexity.
  * We no longer have @opts and @params but #options and #params from Cell::Base.
  * The params hash is appended to the event in RequestProcessor#process_for. You can now live completely without accessing the global #params.
  
  * Event delegates #[] to #data.

h3. Removals
  * Removed #param, it is simply too complex.
  * Removed #jump_to_state.
  * Removed `@cell`, now longer available in state views.
  
h3. Bugfixes
  * Widget.responds_to_event no longer shares its options with multiple widget instances of the same class.


h2. 1.0.4

h3. Bugfixes
    * Caching states works, again. Thanks to Gudleik Rasch for spotting.
    * We cleanly require cells-3.4.x now. Thanks to Ryan Bates who remarked that Apotomo 1.0.x tries to require cells-3.5, which was wrong.

h3. Notes

    * Removed the usage of state-args. If you want the event instance in your triggered state, use @opts[:event] or upgrade to apotomo-1.1.


h2. 1.0.3

h3. Bugfixes
  * fixed gemspec to not require useless gem dependencies.


h2. 1.0.2

h3. Changes
  * removals from ViewHelper: #trigger_event, #form_to_event and friends as they use deprecated Rails helpers.
  
h3. Bugfixes
  * Widget#fire now accepts payload data for the fired event.
  * triggered states now receive the event object if they expect one argument.
