Testing
-------
- something like #assert_event, so we can check if a certain event was triggered
- announce #last_state as stable test method

State Machine
-------------
- better debug-output for transitions
- make #transition_map friendly, maybe some more sophisticated DSL

Parameter
---------
- introduce #my_param or something similar so widgets can only access parameters really 
  addressed to them. or let #param do this per default.
