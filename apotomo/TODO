Testing
-------
- something like #assert_event, so we can check if a certain event was triggered
- announce #last_state as stable test method
- provide something like #assert_transition to test if FSM goes where we want
- assert_update/assert_execute, to assert which components are updated (e.g. after
  event chain)

State Machine
-------------
- better debug-output for transitions
- make #transition_map friendly, maybe some more sophisticated DSL

Parameter
---------
- introduce #my_param or something similar so widgets can only access parameters really 
  addressed to them. or let #param do this per default.

Persistence
-----------
- only save id of ActiveRecords, to avoid big sessions (discuss whether this is necessary)
- make WidgetTree persistent, so it can be modified dynamically
- provide a way to attach observers within widgets, not globally in the WidgetTree

Events
------
- calls to *_to_event should attach a persistent event-handler instead of doing this 
  on the fly. This fixes a security hole where users can trigger arbitrary events
  through /apotomo/event.
