= Apotomo

Apotomo is a stateful widget component framework for Rails.

This software package is developed using the Engines plugin. To find out more about how to use engines in general, go to http://rails-engines.rubyforge.org for general documentation about the Engines mechanism.

== Installation

1. Create your Rails application, set up your databases, grab the Engines plugin and the Apotomo, and install them.

2. Install the Apotomo into your vendor/plugins directory

3. Modify your Engines.start call in config/environment.rb

    Engines.start :apotomo # or :apotomo

4. Edit your application.rb file so it looks something like the following:

    class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
      include Apotomo
    end

5. Edit your application_helper.rb file:

    module ApplicationHelper
      include Apotomo
    end

6. Perform any configuration you might need. You'll probably want to set these values in environment.rb (before the call to Engines.start):

    module Apotomo
      config :some_option, "some_value"
    end

7. Initialize the database tables. You can either use the engine migrations by calling:

    rake engine_migrate

  to move all engines to their latest versions, or

    rake engine_migrate ENGINE=apotomo

  to migrate only this engine.

8. The Apotomo provides a default stylesheet and a small javascript helper file, so you'll probably want to include the former and almost certainly the latter in your application's layout. Add the following lines:

      <%= engine_stylesheet "apotomo_engine" %>
      <%= engine_javascript "apotomo_engine" %>

== Configuration

A number of configuration parameters are available to allow to you control
how the data is stored, should you be unhappy with the defaults. These are
outlined below. 

  module Apotomo
    config :some_option, "some_value"
  end

=== Configuration Options
+some_option+:: This option will set some_value
