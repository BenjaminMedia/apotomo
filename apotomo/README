= Apotomo

Apotomo is a stateful widget component framework for Rails.


== What are widgets?

Apotomo::StatefulWidget is the base class for any widget in Apotomo. Widgets are derived cells[http://cells.rubyforge.org/rdoc], meaning
they basically look and behave like super-fast mini-controllers known from Rails.
State actions in a widget are like controller actions - they implement
the business logic in a method and can render a corresponding view.

I will demonstrate Apotomo's key concepts using the famous and tiresome counter 
example:

 class MyCounterCell < Apotomo::StatefulWidget
   def transition_map
     { :counter => [:_increment]
     }
  end

  def counter
    @count = 0
    nil
  end

  def _increment
    @count += 1
    state_view :counter
  end
end

This widget could be embedded into an existing Rails controller using the 
Apotomo::ControllerHelper#act_as_widget method.

 class ExistingController < ApplicationController
   include Apotomo::ControllerHelper

   def counter_action
     act_as_widget('nicks_counter')
   end
 end

A call to Apotomo::ControllerHelper#act_as_widget instructs Apotomo to look in the
ApplicationWidgetTree for
a widget named <tt>nicks_counter</tt>, render this widget and receive and process 
apotomo events from now on.
The ApplicationWidgetTree (currently it's "only" static) is located in the file 
<tt>app/apotomo/application_widget_tree.rb</tt> and could look like this:

 class ApplicationWidgetTree < Apotomo::WidgetTree
   def draw(root)
     root << cell(:my_counter, :counter, 'nicks_counter')
   end
 end

This models the application. Our current demonstration app is quite small, but anyway
we attach the MyCounterCell widget to the root and name it <tt>nicks_counter</tt>.
As its start state is set to <tt>:counter</tt>, the widget will start in 
this state when it is invoked by Apotomo::ControllerHelper#act_as_widget.
The <tt>:counter</tt> state method just resets the instance variable <tt>@counter</tt>
and automatically renders the corresponding view in
<tt>app/cells/my_counter/counter.html.erb</tt>:

 I am a counter: <h1><%= @count %></h1>
 <%= link_to_event "Increment me!", :state => :_increment %>


So when browsing to <tt>http://localhost:3000/existing/counter_action</tt> the user will see a zero counter
and a link. Being a curious user, he clicks on this link!


== Transitions

Such a curious click is rewarded by triggering an Apotomo event. Some default event
handler sends the widget <tt>nicks_counter</tt> to its <tt>:_increment</tt> state. 
Looking at Apotomo::StatefulWidget#transition_map in our widget, this is an allowed transition.

The <tt>:_increment</tt> state method makes a small addition and - surprise! -
increments the counter. By calling Apotomo::StatefulWidget#state_view it instructs 
the rendering mechanism to render the view we already know. 


== Persistence

Where does the instance variable <tt>@count</tt> come from in the state method
<tt>_increment</tt>? Remember, it's a <em>stateful</em> widget! They save their state between 
requests and restore all instance variables in the next state as if there wouldn't have
been any request at all.


== Nesting

Just for the sake of fun we write another widget with one state only. It will 
simply display a small form. Right now, this doesn't make any sense. And it won't make 
sense later.

  class FormCell < Apotomo::StatefulWidget
    def dumb_form
    end
  end

When rendered the widget would just be a form with an input field and a submit button.
Let's push it into our application in the ApplicationWidgetTree:

  class ApplicationWidgetTree < Apotomo::WidgetTree
    def draw(root)
      root << form= cell(:form, :dumb_form, 'my_dumb_form')
        form << cell(:my_counter, :counter, 'nicks_counter')
    end
  end

What's going on here? We <em>nested</em> the widgets! When rendered, we will see the
simple form <em>containing</em> a counter widget .

== Events

Let's assume the corresponding view for <tt>:dumb_form</tt> would be
<tt>app/cells/form/dumb_form.html.erb</tt>:
  
  <%= form_to_event :type => :dumb %>
    <%= text_field_tag :some_text %>
    <%= submit_tag %>
  </form>

  <%= @content.join("") %>
  
When submitted Apotomo::ViewHelper#form_to_event triggers an event, it's type will be
<tt>:dumb</tt> and the event source is <tt>my_dumb_form</tt>. This is amazing, anyway,
nothing will happen since there isn't an event <em>handler</em> for this event.

== Event Handler

It would be cool if the counter widget could observe this form. If the user entered an
integer in the input field, it could be the new counter value. Instantly we extend 
<tt>MyCounterCell</tt>:

  class MyCounterCell < Apotomo::StatefulWidget
    def transition_map
      { :counter    => [:_increment],
        :_increment => [:_increment, :_set],
        :_set       => [:_increment, :_set],
      }
    end
    
    def _set
      @count = param(:some_text) # I omit a type check! Shame on me!
      state_view :counter
    end
    
    ...
    ...
  end

We <em>know</em> that the form fires a <tt>:dumb</tt> event when submitted, so we should
watch out for this event. In the ApplicationWidgetTree, we add:

    root.watch(:dumb, 'nicks_counter', :_set, nil)

This attaches an event handler to the root widget, it says "whenever a <tt>:dumb</tt> 
event is triggered, regardless of the event source, invoke the state <tt>:_set</tt>
on the widget named <tt>nicks_counter</tt>.

Ok, summarize this: the user enters some value in the input field, submits the form, 
the event bubbles up from the source up to root, where it is catched.
What happens next is that the counter widget is updated, having the value the user
entered. Cool!
